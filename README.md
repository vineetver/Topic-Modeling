## About

The dataset is from [webrobots.io](https://webrobots.io/indiegogo-dataset/). The dataset contains data from all the projects hosted on the Indiegogo platform. 

I implemented topic modelling on the project descriptions of all the projects hosted on Indiegogo. Topic modeling is used to cluster similar documents together. Latent Semantic Analysis (LSA) and  Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) to cluster the project descriptions.   

LSA is a statistical technique used to analyze relationships between documents and the terms they contain by producing a set of concepts related to the documents and terms. In contrast, LDA is a statistical technique used to automatically discover the topics represented in a collection of documents.
